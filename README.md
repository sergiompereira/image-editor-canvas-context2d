# Image Editor on Canvas (Context2d)
Image processing interface with point, convolution and distribution filters, based on the Context2D of Html canvas element.

## A Welcome to contributors
If you would like to improve this project, I would suggest working on the following issues and improvements:

### Issues
- Canvas become black when a new image is uploaded (changing one of the sliders solves the problem).
- Canvas become black when monotone or duotone colours are changed after setting any other value.
- The colour picker hint doesn't match the precise position of the mouse.
- Doesn't work in Firefox.

### Improvements
- Make contrast slider more sensitive
- Make threshold slider more sensitive

### New features
- Add an unsharp mask filter
- Add a noise reduction filter

It would also be great if someone would try to migrate this project to a WebGL context implementation.
